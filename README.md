# BookCatalog
A console application to simulate BookCatalog

Supports:

1) Add new books
2) Search book by Partial name of book/Author.

This can be extended by Adding classes to Author, catagory and Publisher so that by maintaining a list of books in those classes can give additional futures like getting top books that are sold under each catagory or author or publisher.
